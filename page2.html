    <h2>What you need to know</h2>
    <p>When shopping at the grocery store, choosing clean and whole foods can be simple by focusing on items that are close to their natural form. Fresh fruits and vegetables are a great place to start, especially ones with short ingredient lists or no packaging at all. Whole grains like oats, brown rice, and quinoa are good options when they are plain and not heavily flavored. For proteins, look for eggs, beans, nuts, and fresh meat with no added ingredients. Reading labels and choosing foods with fewer, easy-to-recognize ingredients can help beginners make healthier, more natural choices.</p>
    <p>For beginners, it can also be helpful to know which ingredients or foods to avoid when aiming for a clean and whole diet. Many people try to limit highly processed foods, especially those with long ingredient lists or artificial colors and flavors. Most refined oils, such as vegetable oil, soybean oil, and canola oil, are often avoided because they are heavily processed. Foods with added sugars, artificial sweeteners, or preservatives are also best to avoid. Choosing simpler foods with natural ingredients makes it easier to support a healthier lifestyle. Personally, I like to use an app called BobbyApproved. It allows me to scan any product and see exactly which ingredients are harmful to my body. It helps me a lot when grocery shopping because it is important to be aware of each ingredient.</p>
